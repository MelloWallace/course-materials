Explanation: This program scans for available ports. It will scan for ports by using the worker method to open and test the port, then it will close the port. It will
maintain a list of open and closed ports as well.

Changes:
An explanation has been added on how to run the program(both scanner test and main)

Dial has been changed to DialTimeout with a timeout of 21 seconds.

Added a variable, closed ports to track the closed ports, also made sure
to add any clsoed ports to the list with a loop.

Changed the ports from 100 to 111.

Printed out the closed ports and the open ports, and a string containting the length
of both variables.

Returned both the length of the closed ports and the open ports.

Changed the scanner test to test the closed ports and modified all tests to
handle the new port scanner method.

Changed the port scanner method to take in a variable rather than being null
modified all files to accomodate the changes and constructed a variable of ints with 
a hard coded length of 1024..
